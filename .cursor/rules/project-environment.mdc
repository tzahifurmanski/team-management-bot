# Guidlines
* Whenever asked to make a change, make the change and then run the project's tests. If there are any errors, go back and fix the issues. Repeat until all tests are passing, and there are no linting errors.

# Testing
* Project testing is done via Jest

* Project mocking is also done via Jest. Keep in mind that the project modules are in the ES6 standard, so you need to use unstable_mock and similar functions.


# Development style 
Develop it using TDD style (use the corresponding cursor rule), and keep going until the tests pass successfully without errors.
Keep in mind that the project is using ES6 standard, so standard mocking won't work (and you should use things like unstable_mock).
